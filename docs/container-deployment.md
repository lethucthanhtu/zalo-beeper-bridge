# Container deployment — Docker or Podman

One image runs **both** processes the bridge needs: the appservice (`node src/index.ts`)
and `bbctl proxy`. They share the container's loopback, so `registration.yaml` keeps
`url: http://localhost:29350` and nothing is published on the host.

> Run exactly **one** instance per registration. A second bridge/proxy (another
> container, `npm run dev`, a launchd agent, `bbctl proxy` in WSL…) kicks the first.

## 1. Inputs (`container-config/`, gitignored)

| File                             | Where it comes from                                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `config.yaml`                    | `cp config.yaml.example` and fill in (relative paths are fine — they resolve to `/data`) |
| `registration.yaml`              | `bbctl register -o registration.yaml sh-zalo`, with `url: http://localhost:29350`        |
| `bbctl-config.json` _(optional)_ | your existing `~/.config/bbctl/config.json` (Beeper login; `bbctl proxy` needs it)       |

Instead of `bbctl-config.json` you can set `MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN` (the `access_token`
from that file), or log in inside the container once:

```bash
docker compose run --rm zalo-bridge bbctl login      # or: podman compose run --rm ...
```

On rootless Podman the files must be readable by the container user: `chmod 644`
them on the host (a 600 file is unreadable inside). On SELinux hosts (Fedora/RHEL)
change the mount in `compose.yaml` to `./container-config:/config:ro,Z`.

## 2. Run

```bash
# Docker
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f

# Podman (podman compose uses podman-compose or docker-compose as provider)
podman compose up -d --build
podman logs -f zalo-beeper-bridge
```

Without compose:

```bash
podman build -t localhost/zalo-beeper-bridge .          # or docker build
podman run -d --name zalo-beeper-bridge --restart unless-stopped \
  -v ./container-config:/config:ro -v zalo-data:/data \
  localhost/zalo-beeper-bridge
```

Healthy startup log:

```
Appservice listening on localhost:29350 ...
DBG Appservice transaction websocket opened        <- bbctl proxy connected to Beeper
[zalo] no valid saved credentials — send 'login'   <- first run only
```

## 3. Add the Zalo account and sync

1. In Beeper, open the DM with `@sh-zalobot:beeper.local` and send `login`.
2. Scan the QR with the Zalo phone app and confirm. Expect `✓ Logged in to Zalo`.
3. Send `sync`. It creates a room for pinned chats and **every** group, joins you
   into them, and fills empty rooms with whatever history Zalo hands this session.
   It is paced (1.5 s per step); ~50 groups take about 2 minutes.

From then on every new Zalo message (DM or group, including ones you send from the
phone) appears in Beeper. Zalo does not re-send what arrived while the bridge was away
(container down, PC asleep, network drop), so after every (re)connect the bridge pages
back through this session's recent feed until it meets a message it already bridged —
up to 10 pages (~500 messages) per DMs and groups — and replays the gap in order
(deduplicated by msgId). The log shows `[sync] catch-up user|group: N page(s)`.

The encrypted Zalo session lives on the `zalo-data` volume, so restarts and rebuilds
re-login silently (`[zalo] re-logged in from saved credentials`).

### What Zalo does not allow

- **History from before the login.** Zalo only serves a web session the messages it
  received after that session was created. Cloud group history comes back
  `isFiltered=1` (the server has the messages but withholds them); DMs are kept on the
  phone, not on Zalo's servers. Zalo's own apps get old chats only via the phone's
  "sync messages" transfer, which no third-party client can use.
- **Original timestamps** for caught-up/backfilled messages (they carry bridge time).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                                      | Check                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chats missing in Beeper although the log shows `[zalo] in …` | You were left at "invite" (old versions). Restart: startup joins you into every portal        |
| No `[zalo] in/own …` lines at all                            | Close Zalo Web/PC tabs (one web session only), then `logout` + `login`                        |
| Unknown protocol frames                                      | `ZALO_WS_TRACE=1 podman compose up -d` logs every frame header (cmd/size only, never content) |
| Network visible in Beeper Desktop, but no chats              | Remote-account state missing — runbook, "Beeper Desktop shows the Zalo network but no chats"  |

Each bridged Zalo message logs one line with ids only: `[zalo] in group text thread=… msg=…`.
End-to-end-encrypted 1-1 pushes (cmd 551, dropped by zca-js) are rerouted to the DM handler.

## State and backup

Everything stateful is in the named volume (`/data`): `bridge.db` (portal/message
mapping), `zalo-creds.session.json` + its key, and the bbctl login. A named volume is
used on purpose: SQLite WAL is unreliable on Windows bind mounts.

```bash
docker run --rm -v zalo-beeper-bridge_zalo-data:/data -v "$PWD":/backup busybox \
  tar czf /backup/zalo-data.tgz -C /data .
```

## History import and a second account

- Import history with `scripts/zalo-pc/import.ps1` (Windows) or `scripts/zalo-pc/import.sh` (macOS) — see the README section "Importing Zalo history". They run the importer inside this container (`-ContainerCli docker` / `-r docker` for Docker, `-Container` / `-n` for another container name).
- A second Zalo account runs as a second bridge with its own `bbctl register` name, config dir and volume — see the README section "Multiple Zalo accounts".

## Limits

- Backfilled messages only go into rooms that are still empty (old messages are never
  appended below newer ones in a room that already shows messages).
- Podman builds OCI images, which drop the Dockerfile `HEALTHCHECK`; `compose.yaml`
  declares it again so both engines report health. Both probe the appservice's own
  `GET /health` (served by matrix-appservice) with `curl`, as does the entrypoint before
  it starts `bbctl proxy`.
